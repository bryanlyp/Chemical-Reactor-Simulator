# Chemical Reactor Simulator
This program simulates a user-defined chemical process with editable chemical reaction parameters (reaction co-efficients and reaction orders).
This program includes a functional GUI. Differential equations are solved numerically and an iterative solver is implemented using the Newton-Raphson method.
